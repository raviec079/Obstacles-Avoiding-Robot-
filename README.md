# Obstacles-Avoiding-Robot-
The project describes about an obstacle avoidance robot vehicle which uses ultrasonic sensors. The robot is made using ultrasonic sensor and it is controlled by Arduino microcontroller. Ultrasonic sensor fixed in front portion of the robot vehicle. The sensor senses the obstacles and deviate its path to choose an obstacle free path. The sensor will be sending the data to the controller is compared with controller to decide the movement of the robot wheel. The robot wheel movement and direction will be based on the sensing of the ultrasonic sensor and also using a wheel encoder. This vehicle is used for detecting obstacle and avoiding the collision.
